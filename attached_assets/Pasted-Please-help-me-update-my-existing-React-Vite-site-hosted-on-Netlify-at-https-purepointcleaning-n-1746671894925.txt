Please help me update my existing React + Vite site hosted on Netlify at https://purepointcleaning.netlify.app based on the following changes:
	1.	Trust Section / Licensing Info:

	•	Add a section titled “Trusted & Covered” or “Peace of Mind Guaranteed”
	•	Include clear text: “We are licensed, bonded, and fully insured for your protection.”
	•	Add 3 simple trust badges/icons for: Licensed, Bonded, Insured
	•	Mention: “We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all services.”

	2.	Hero Section Enhancements:

	•	Update the headline and subheadline to be bolder, more professional, and commercial-focused.
	•	Example headline: “Professional Commercial Cleaning You Can Count On”
	•	Example sub: “With decades of combined experience, our team delivers top-tier service for businesses that expect the best.”
	•	Replace any images that look residential with more commercial cleaning visuals (offices, lobbies, conference rooms)

	3.	Experience Statement:

	•	Somewhere near the About or Hero section, add this sentence:
“With cleaners who bring decades of experience, we believe top-notch talent should care for top-notch customers.”

	4.	FAQ Section Reordering:

	•	Move current FAQ number 5 to be the first question

	5.	Service List Update:

	•	In the Services section, reorder items as follows:
	•	Offices
	•	Churches
	•	Event Spaces
	•	Public Businesses
	•	Clothing Stores (last)

	6.	100-Point Inspection Statement:

	•	In the Services or “Why Choose Us” section, include a line that says:
“Every clean includes a 100-point inspection to ensure unmatched quality and service.”

	7.	Form Submission:

	•	Update the contact form so the response email goes to the new main email (not Tres’)
	•	Set a custom confirmation message to show after submitting the form, like:
“Thank you! Your request has been received. We’ll be in touch shortly to schedule your service.”

	8.	Add a “What Makes Us Different” Page (or Section):

	•	Create a new page or section titled “What Makes Us Different”
	•	Include bullet points like:
	•	Price Match Guarantee
	•	Detailed Closeout Process with Photo Documentation
	•	Licensed, Bonded & Insured
	•	100-Point Post-Clean Inspection
	•	Decades of Combined Experience

Keep all visual styling and structure consistent with the rest of the site.
